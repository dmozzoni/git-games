House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned gets his head chopped off after trying to prevent the illegitamate Joffery from asending to the throne after King R obert's death.
